# WebSocket Implementation Plan

## 1. Establish Basic Connection (Completed)

- [x] Simplify WebSocketTester component to minimize console logging
- [x] Add WebSocketTester to Dashboard for easy testing (dev mode only)
- [x] Verify basic connection works without errors
- [x] Ensure environment variables are properly configured:
  - `VITE_WS_URL` should be set to the WebSocket server URL (e.g., `ws://localhost:5000/ws`)

## 2. Authentication Flow (Completed)

- [x] Implement proper token passing in WebSocket connection
- [x] Handle authentication response from server
- [x] Add reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- [x] Show connection status in the UI

## 3. Bidding System Implementation (In Progress)

- [x] Implement real-time bid placement from driver
- [x] Handle bid status updates
- [x] Add notifications for bid events (accepted, rejected)
- [ ] Update bidder list in real-time when new bids come in

## 4. Available Bookings Integration (Added)

- [x] Create API endpoint for fetching available bookings with radius filter
- [x] Update AvailableBookings.jsx to fetch real data from API
- [x] Add fallback to demo data when API fails
- [x] Implement proper error handling on both frontend and backend
- [ ] Add real geospatial queries for radius search (future enhancement)

## 5. Bug Fixes (Added)

- [x] Fix WebSocket infinite loop issue using refs instead of state
- [x] Fix WebSocket reconnection logic to prevent resource exhaustion
- [x] Fix Booking ID format handling for bidding (support both MongoDB ObjectIDs and custom IDs)
- [x] Improve error handling and feedback for users

## 6. Driver Status Updates (Pending)

- [ ] Implement driver location sharing
- [ ] Allow drivers to update their availability status
- [ ] Implement booking status updates in real-time

## 7. Chat/Messaging System (Pending)

- [ ] Add direct messaging between customers and drivers
- [ ] Implement notifications for new messages
- [ ] Show message read status

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Verify connection works consistently
- [x] Test authentication flow
- [x] Test connection recovery after network issues
- [ ] Verify bidding system works in real-time
- [ ] Test performance with multiple connections

## Performance Considerations

1. Minimize unnecessary reconnections ✓
2. Implement proper error handling ✓
3. Use event delegation pattern for message handling ✓
4. Batch updates when possible to reduce UI renders ✓
5. Clean up WebSocket connections when components unmount ✓

## Troubleshooting Guide

1. **Console errors about WebSocket connection:**

   - Check if the backend server is running
   - Verify VITE_WS_URL is correct
   - Check if token is valid

2. **Authentication failures:**

   - Verify token format is correct
   - Check token expiration

3. **"Insufficient resources" errors:**

   - This is fixed with the new reconnection logic
   - The browser is running out of WebSocket connections
   - Wait for the cooldown period (2 minutes) before trying again

4. **"Maximum update depth exceeded" errors:**
   - This is fixed by using refs instead of state for event handlers
   - Clear your browser cache and try again if you still see this error
